### ExperienceðŸ”­

**Grand Blanc High School student**

- I have babysat many kids. I am very good at entertaining kids while ensuring they are learning and doing worthwhile activities. 
- Another thing I do is paint apartments with my mom. This requires lots of physical and mental strength because the work is taxing. 
- I am also the team captain of my national volleyball travel team. This job requires me to stay strong and bring my teammates up even when personally discouraged. On top of that, I suggest certain plays and positions to put my teammates in.
